## Protocol amplification attacks

##### What is this repo?
###### This is a repo of daily, weekly, and monthly reports I'm generating based on ongoing protocol amplification attacks.


##### Which protocols does this track?:
1. DNS
2. NTP
3. Chargen
4. QoTD
5. SSDP


##### How is the data being collecting?
###### Honeypots. Currently I'm running 6 honeypots that appear to be offering vulnerable versions of the abovementioned protols. These honeypots end up in lists of open XXX (where XXX is the protocol in question) servers -- i.e. open DNS recursors, open NTP servers, etc.
